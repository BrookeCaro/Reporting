In order to get the correct region, we have to do a conditional join to the State table based on the isMailing value, prioritizing State value where isMailing is 0. The Regions table is then joined twice, once to get the region listed on the File, which may be different and is used in the coalesce as a back up value, and then again to get the region associated with the State.\n",
